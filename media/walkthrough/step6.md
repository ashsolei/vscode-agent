# Step 6: Analytics Dashboard

Track your agent usage with built-in telemetry:

- Total calls and success rate
- Per-agent statistics
- Daily/hourly breakdown
- Response time averages
- Most used agents

All data stays local – nothing is sent externally.

Use `Cmd+Shift+T` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+T` to open the dashboard.
