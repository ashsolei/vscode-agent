# Step 5: Autonomous Agents

Autonomous agents can work independently:

- **/scaffold** – Generate entire projects
- **/autofix** – Find and fix all errors automatically
- **/fullstack** – Build complete web apps
- **/devops** – Set up CI/CD pipelines
- **/migrate** – Migrate between frameworks

Each autonomous agent:
1. Plans the work
2. Executes step by step
3. Verifies the result
4. Iterates if needed

Guardrails ensure safety with rollback support.
